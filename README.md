# Absent 

A Godot project for a reverse horror game where you play as an infected entity struggling to balance infection and scavenging for stims.

The rough GDD can be found here:  https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/67a6aa8b17e08191add3ba54ae35439e

## Features

- **Reverse Horror Concept:** Assume the role of a zombie-like entity that must infect humans or scavenge for stims to stave off withdrawal.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized folder hierarchy for assets, scenes, scripts, docs, and config files to support a growing codebase.
- **Scalable & Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns with autoload managers and dedicated folders for gameplay logic.
- **Documentation Included:** Design documents and planning notes are available in the `docs/` folder.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and open it in Godot. For setup instructions and development guidelines, refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder.
